  Dart Programming - Overview.
---

Dart is an **object-oriented** language with **C-style** syntax which can optionally trans compile into JavaScript. It supports a varied range of programming aids like `interfaces`, `classes`, `collections`, `generics`, and `optional typing`.

Dart can be extensively used to create **single-page applications**. **Single-page applications** apply only to websites and web applications. **Single-page applications** enable navigation between different screens of the website without loading a different webpage in the browser. A classic example is **GMail** ─ when you click on a message in your inbox, browser stays on the same webpage, but JavaScript code hides the inbox and brings the message body on screen.

Google has released a special build of Chromium – the Dart VM. Using Dartium means you don’t have to compile your code to JavaScript until you’re ready to test on other browsers.

The following table compares the features of Dart and JavaScript.
