  A brief introduction of web application.

In computing, a **web application** or **web app** is a *client-server computer program* that the client (including the user interface and client-side logic) runs in a web browser. Common web applications include webmail, online retail sales, online banking, and online auctions. 

## Definition and similar terms

The general distinction between a *dynamic web page* of any kind and a "*web application*" is unclear. Web sites most likely to be referred to as "web applications" are those which have similar functionality to a desktop software application, or to a mobile app. HTML5 introduced explicit language support for making applications that are loaded as web pages, but can store data locally and continue to function while offline.

**Single-page applications** are more application-like because they reject the more typical web paradigm of moving between distinct pages with different URLs. Single-page frameworks might be used to speed development of such a web app for a mobile platform.
